## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supplyflow.git
cd supplyflow

# Install all dependencies
npm run install-all

## 📊 Business Logic Implementation

### Supply Chain Calculations
```javascript
// Economic Order Quantity
EOQ = √((2 × Annual Demand × Ordering Cost) / Holding Cost)

// Reorder Point
ROP = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

// Safety Stock
Safety Stock = Z-score × Demand Std Dev × √Lead Time

// ABC Analysis
Categorizes products by cumulative inventory value contribution
```
