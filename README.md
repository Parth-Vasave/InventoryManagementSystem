## 📊 Business Logic Implementation

### Supply Chain Calculations
```javascript
// Economic Order Quantity
EOQ = √((2 × Annual Demand × Ordering Cost) / Holding Cost)

// Reorder Point
ROP = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

// Safety Stock
Safety Stock = Z-score × Demand Std Dev × √Lead Time

// ABC Analysis
Categorizes products by cumulative inventory value contribution
```
